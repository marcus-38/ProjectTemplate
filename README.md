# ProjectTemplate
My C++ Project Template

Based of TheCherno at https://github.com/TheCherno/ProjectTemplate/tree/master

Don't base your code on mine, I don't really know what I'm doing. Check out TheCherno instead.

## What do I have to do
To use this project template you have to check/edit the following:
0. Don't use this template, use ttps://github.com/TheCherno/ProjectTemplate/tree/master instead
1. make sure you have the correct architecture in build.lua
2. check that the build script is correct for your system
3. make the build script executable, if needed
4. change project name, core name and app name (if you want)
